Multiple clusters should be usable
- Concurrently-running clusters
- Should be able to swap between them instantly
- All source/datadir/ports should follow the same pattern
- Source/dir/port patterns should match GPDB version
- Should be able to navigate segment dirs, utility mode, etc. through aliases/variables

Should be easy to work with 4x vs. 5x vs. 6x code lines
- Separate clones/directories for 5x and 6x
- Consistently-named remotes for the other versions, for cherry-picking between versions
- Swapping between versions should change source trees
