# config file for ansible -- https://ansible.com/
# ===============================================

# nearly all parameters can be overridden in ansible-playbook
# or with command line flags. ansible will read ANSIBLE_CONFIG,
# ansible.cfg in the current working directory, .ansible.cfg in
# the home directory or /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg, whichever it
# finds first

[defaults]

# some basic default values...

# This points us at the inventory generated by Vagrant
inventory      =  .vagrant/provisioners/ansible/inventory

# There are lots of other config settings that can be explored later, see:
# https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/devel/examples/ansible.cfg
